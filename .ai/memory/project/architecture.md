# Architecture Memory

## Current application shape

- Frontend: Vite + React in `src/client`
- Backend: Express in `src/server`
- Shared boundary: Zod contracts in `src/shared/contracts`
- Harness: checked-in docs under `.ai/` plus canonical repo rules in `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`

## Core execution model

- The UI consumes typed review payloads and should not contain compliance logic.
- The server owns OpenAI orchestration and deterministic validators.
- Final compliance outcomes must come from deterministic checks over structured extraction, not from a single model verdict.

## Guardrails

- No persistence of uploaded labels, application data, or review results
- OpenAI Responses API only for new model work
- `store: false` on every request
- Low-confidence visual judgments downgrade to `review`
